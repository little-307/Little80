                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                        <p id="article">My background in development and tech officially started a little over a year ago with a canceled trip to Las Vegas because of COVID-19.
                        I had an idea to create a simple mobile app that would track small daily wins to help achieve the larger goals in one’s personal life. 
                        Using the money saved from the canceled trip I purchased a new MacBook Pro. After loading Xcode, I quickly realized that I had a long road of learning some new languages to make “Jar of Goals” a reality. 
                        About a month later my brother shared a link to apply for ARRAY’s apprenticeship program, where I was given links to learn HTML and CSS. 
                        Going through the exercises I found my sense of wonder in the field rushing in at an exciting rate. I WAS HOOKED!</p>
                        
                        <p id="article">The past year since being declined a spot in the ARRAY apprentice program, I started shifting my focus towards the design side of web and app development. 
                        I Took a course in UX/UI where I started a capstone project with the focus on fundraising. Now after doing all the research, interviews, and wireframes. 
                        I’m in the process of creating a style sheet to take to my high-res and prototyping. This is where I get into the “Why I want to become a developer”.</p>
                        
                        <p id="article">While going through the design process for my capstone project in UX/UI. I realized that I really want to know how to make my idea into a real running application that people can use. 
                        Then why stop there? I would love the opportunity to help other people and communities turn their ideas into a reality for a living.</p>

                        <h2>After ARRAY</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p id="article">I would love to be a part of the Apprenticeship program at Array where I can really find my niche areas in the development process of a website or app. 
                                Then finding a full time position at an established company or startup. Maybe dabble in the freelance side of things.</p></li>
                            <li><p id="article">I would like to take what I learn from ARRAY and real world development experience, and Instruct future developers that come from a mining or oil & gas background here in NorthEast Wyoming.</p></li>
