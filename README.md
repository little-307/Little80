the Moth.mp4 file was too large to upload via the website. the same file was commited before in the git orientation located in the video-background file.
need to figure out how to move files and folders aroud on GitHub.
-- By adding the file through commiting the changes via commandline I was able to apply the larger file. 
-- Note to self, Think about the image size and resolution and how that will affect loading speeds and overall cost in the long run when hosting.
